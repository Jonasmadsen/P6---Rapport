Location: Meeting was held on discord due to COVID 19.

Agenda? We have none. 

We have changed windows size and the amount of gru cells we get some loss values that look better. 
Mean square error looks good, negative log likelyhood is bad.
Our loss function is wrong. Our learning rate is too high.

Tung is willing to debug it if the code is clean. In the mean time we can use mean square error.
We will send him the code and do a simple debug.

We can send the report and have another meeting.

Short meeting.  yes.
