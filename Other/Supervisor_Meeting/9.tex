Nævn at modellen er blevet dårligere.
Vi har en nær færdig rapport til ham på fredag.

We have hit a wall with the model. 5000 epochs is too many.  We implimented a decaying learning rate with early stopping and such, however it it still is not very good.

Even when we turn it all off it still is quite bad.

We cut the timeseries into sliding windows in size 64. 32 Dense units and 32 in the GRU layer. 

We must train many models and find the best model.
