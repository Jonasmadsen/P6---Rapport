As you possibly know, we follow the Theory of Science course this year. 

During the last part of this course, we have been given the assignment to interview you. Your answers to the below questions will be used by everyone in the group - we have to sum up the answers in individually written 1-page-essays. 

We hope you will participate in the interview: 

1. In what area of science do you research? 
2. Who are the most important persons within your specific area of research?
3. What are the most important problem(s) that is being researched and tried to solve within this research area?
4. How is a given hypothesis being verified or falsified within this research area? 
5. How is your research being funded? 


My research is Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. Someone can call Data Analytics.
I can list here a few influencers. Because none is the "most important"

The most important problem is (1) increasing the accuracy in prediction problems (2) reducing the computational time. 
The code and dataset are usually public and it is easy to run code to reproduce the result. Sometimes the results can be achieved through mathematical proofing (e.g., lower bound, upper bound)
My research is funded by the Ph.D. project (for me it comes from Obel Family Foundation).
