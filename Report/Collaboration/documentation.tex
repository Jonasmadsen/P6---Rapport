\oldsection*{aSTEP Documentation}
In the first sprint, the \gls{astep} code-base was explored to understand the architecture and platform. There was some trouble getting proper, consistent documentation for the different services.
We proposed to use a Wiki type documentation system, and with help from the group, SW606F20 got it implemented in the interface. After multiple implementation options were considered, we chose Wiki.js \cite{wikijs} due to the modern look and simple deployment with \gls{docker}. It now includes both \gls{rfc}-list, meeting summaries, FAQ, server help, and service documentation. It makes all documentation for every \gls{astep} related activity available in one place. Our group collaborated with group SW603F20 to improve the documentation for \gls{kubernetes} in the Wiki.
