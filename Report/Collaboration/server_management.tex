\oldsection*{Server Management}
It was chosen that one person from each group should take part in the server group, which made it possible for every group to get access to the server through their chosen server person. This made the server responsibility more scattered and avoided expertise islands.

A chatroom only accessible to the server group members was created, here they could share tips and collaborate on common server issues. This proved useful multiple times in various scenarios like:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Crashed Services
    \item Full disk/Resource limits
    \item Updating \gls{kubernetes}/\gls{gitlab}/Ubuntu
    \item Database management
    \item Reinstalling/configuring applications
\end{itemize}

\noindent
We also collaborated with \gls{its} on several occasions with varying success. Collaboration is needed since they control root access to the \gls{astep} servers.
