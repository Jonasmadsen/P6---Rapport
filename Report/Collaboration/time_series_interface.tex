\oldsection*{Time Series Interface}
The input/output standard for time series data was accepted: 25th of March 2020 in a super-group meeting. The idea is that all the services that work with time-series data should be compatible with each other. The standard would allow for more interesting analytical options. It should be possible to chain different services together as long as they share a common interface. There were multiple meetings and design considerations to make the interface simple and useful.
SW602F20 took on the responsibility of implementing the necessary functionality to show the time series format in existing \gls{astep} chart-implementation. We choose to adopt this interface as we primarily work with time-series data. We took part in the initial discussion phase to make sure it would fit our project. We also tested and validated that our service works with this interface.
