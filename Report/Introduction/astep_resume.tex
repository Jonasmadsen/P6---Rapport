\section{Introduction to aSTEP}
\gls{astep} is a data analytics platform from Aalborg University used primarily as an educational tool for students, as well as provide utility for researchers. \gls{astep} can perform a variety of operations on given data sets, with machine intelligence and heuristic data processing techniques. \gls{astep} is developed as a collaborative project by students doing their sixth semester (as of 2021, fifth semester) projects at Aalborg University. Each year, students work on improving the general usability of the platform, as well as develop new services for data analytics.

\subsection{aSTEP Focus Points}
The project coordinator, Bin Yang, sets the overall goal for this years focus, which applies for all groups that are part of the \gls{astep}-2020 project. The focus points are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A central and consistent documentation.
    \item Core analytic algorithms.
    \item General \gls{ui} improvements.
\end{itemize}
