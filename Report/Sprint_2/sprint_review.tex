\section{Sprint Review} \label{sprint_2_review}
We have reviewed and explored multiple types of related work within anomaly detection. This includes multiple types of \glspl{nn} such as \gls{vae} and \gls{rnn}. By exploring this related work, we intuitively and theoretically got an understanding of \glspl{nn} and their use cases within anomaly detection. We discovered that both \gls{vae} and \gls{rnn} by themselves are not suitable for anomaly detection on time series data, however a combination of the two, \gls{rvae}, has seen use with great results.

Furthermore, our service component architecture was designed and the required interfaces and corresponding \glspl{endpoint} were explained.
