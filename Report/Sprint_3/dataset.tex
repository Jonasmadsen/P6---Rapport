\section{Training Dataset}
Training the \gls{nn} requires a dataset to train on that contains anomalies. Yahoo has a collection of datasets \cite{yahoo_datasets}. One of these datasets (S3) is a collection of time-series data with varying anomalies. This dataset was created by Yahoo to benchmark anomaly detection algorithms. The dataset has both synthetic and real data. The synthetic data has a changing trend, noise, and seasonality, while the real data is data collected by Yahoo from various Yahoo services.
