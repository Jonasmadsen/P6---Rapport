\section{Sprint Goals}
The sprint goals for the third sprint are to continue designing and implementation of the service. The first goal is to design the architecture of the \gls{nn}, so we can then implement it. Before the implementation of the model, we also explore different technology available to do so. We need a machine learning framework and a web framework. We implement the \gls{nn} trained on univariate and multivariate data. After training and ensuring the model works correctly, we expose the service to \gls{astep}.\newline

\noindent
Table \ref{tab:sprint_3_goals} shows a list of goals for the third sprint. The first goal is to design the \gls{nn} architecture. The second goal is to explore and assess relevant technology for implementation. The third goal is to implement the \gls{nn}. As our fourth goal, we should be able to expose the service to \gls{astep} so that others can use the service. Section \ref{sprint_3_review} evaluates these goals in the sprint review.
