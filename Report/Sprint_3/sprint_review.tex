\section{Sprint Review} \label{sprint_3_review}
We have assessed relevant implementation technology and chosen the most suited. We have designed and implemented a functional \gls{nn} in \gls{tensorflow} and exposed it to \gls{astep} \gls{ui} using python-flask and astep-form-utils. During the training of the model, we fine-tuned the hyperparameters to achieve the best \gls{f1score}.

We implemented the common data interface for better inter-service compatibility, especially with other groups that work with time-series data.
