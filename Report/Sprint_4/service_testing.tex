\section{Service Testing}
We tested the service interface mostly manually as it was quite simple and mostly irrelevant for this project's primary focus. There was however, also constructed several unit tests in the pytest framework. These tests were not written with Test Driven Development (TDD) ideas in mind and were more intended to be sanity checks. While this is not ideal, it still provides a second chance to find bugs as the person writing the tests was separate from the one writing the tested code.
