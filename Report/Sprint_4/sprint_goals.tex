\section{Sprint Goals}
The sprint goals for the fourth sprint are to test the model we implemented in the third sprint and compare it to some baseline models. We train multiple models and compare them to each to make sure the results are consistent. Finally, we compare the model to the baselines. We will also perform tests on the service as a whole, to make sure it is accessible and usable through \gls{astep}. \newline

\noindent
Table \ref{tab:sprint_4_goals} shows a list of goals for the fourth sprint. The first goal is to train multiple models and compare them to each other. The second goal is to compare the best model to the baseline models. The best model will then be accessible on \gls{astep}, and the service as a whole will be tested. Section \ref{sprint_4_review} evaluates these goals in the sprint review.
