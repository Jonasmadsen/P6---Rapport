This project is part of the aSTEP project at AAU. It is incrementally improved as part of the software students bachelor projects. 
We implement a service that performs anomaly detection on univariate and multivariate data. The service is integrated into the aSTEP interface and follows a common interface that allows it to interact with other time series services on aSTEP.
The anomaly detection is achieved with a recurrent variational autoencoder.
We achieve !!!INSERT RESULTS!!  !!!INSERT RESULTS!!  !!!INSERT RESULTS!!  !!!INSERT RESULTS!! significantly better than using Local Outlier Factor or Isolation Forest algorithms.
We work together with other groups to improve documentation, server dependability, and inter-service connectivity on the aSTEP platform with the goal of leaving a better aSTEP for next years students.
This report also aims to provide a good starting point for next year's students and document changes and problems we encounter along the way.
